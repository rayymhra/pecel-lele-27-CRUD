💻 1. Web Project – Add More CRUD Pages
Even if not all of these are used fully, include:

✅ Admin Panel:

CRUD for Menu

CRUD for Orders

CRUD for Testimonials

CRUD for Contacts

CRUD for About Us

✅ Separate Admin & User Interface

Login page for admin (even if dummy)

Public-facing user pages

Bonus: Add dummy data entries and make forms long with multiple fields. Even if they’re not strictly necessary.

📊 2. UML Diagrams – Add More Use Cases & Activities
🔹 Use Case Diagram
Include many roles and actions, such as:

Admin:

Add Menu

Edit Menu

Delete Menu

View Orders

Update Order Status

Add Testimonial (on behalf of user)

Update About Us

User:

View Menu

Submit Order

Submit Testimonial

Contact Admin

Tip: Use rectangles, stickmen, lines, extend/include — make it “full”.

🔹 Activity Diagram
Make at least 2 or 3 activity diagrams:

Activity flow for Placing Order

Activity flow for Managing Menu

Activity flow for Viewing Testimonials

Tip: Add decision diamonds (if/else), loops, etc. to make it detailed.

🗃️ 3. ERD – Add More Tables & Fields
Even if your site only needs a few tables, your teacher wants to see a forest.

Here’s how to make it impressive:

Suggested Tables:
Users (id, name, email, password, role)

Menus (id, title, image, price, category, availability, created_at)

Orders (id, user_id, menu_id, quantity, total_price, status, created_at)

Testimonials (id, user_id, message, rating, date_posted)

Contacts (id, name, email, phone, message, responded)

Custom_Orders (id, user_id, event_type, message, budget, date_needed)

About_Us (id, title, description, image_url)

Admins (id, username, password)

Tip: Even if your site doesn’t use login yet, include user/admin distinction. Makes it “enterprise-level”.

🎁 Bonus Moves (that make you look good):
Draw.io Design: Use colors, icons, or labels — neat and complex diagrams look more serious.

Add Comments to ERD: Like “Table to manage customer testimonials to improve credibility”.

Create a README File: Add explanations of your logic for the ERD and UML (as PDF or DOC).

Include Screenshots of your website in the final submission.

Add validation to forms: required fields, error messages — even if basic.

✅ Summary of What to Do
Task	What to Add/Do
Web Project	Add more CRUD pages (even dummy ones), separate admin panel
UML	Add more actors/use cases, 2–3 activity diagrams
